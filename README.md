🕶️ Hidden AI Page

A lightweight stealth interface designed to keep AI assistance accessible — without being obvious.

Hidden AI Page is built for environments where visibility matters. Whether you're screen sharing, presenting, studying, or working in monitored setups, this project gives you a discreet way to access AI tools without drawing attention.

🚀 Overview

Hidden AI Page is a browser-based interface that masks AI usage by blending seamlessly into normal web activity.

Instead of looking like an AI chat window, the page appears ordinary — allowing users to interact with AI in situations where obvious usage may not be ideal.

Think of it as:

AI access without visual noise

Functionality without exposure

Assistance without signalling

🧠 Core Concept

Modern AI tools are powerful — but highly visible.

This project focuses on:

✔ Minimizing detection
✔ Blending into everyday browsing
✔ Maintaining usability while appearing normal

Similar stealth-first tools aim to keep AI usage invisible during screen sharing, recordings, or monitored environments by ensuring the interface does not appear in obvious ways .

Hidden AI Page applies this philosophy in a simple web-based format.

🧩 How It Works

The system focuses on visual neutrality.

Instead of highlighting AI interaction, the page:

Uses neutral layout styling

Avoids obvious chat UI patterns

Integrates AI into a “normal” looking page

The goal is to ensure interaction stays functional while appearance remains ordinary.

🔐 Privacy Focus

This project does not:

Log conversations

Store prompts

Track user activity

All interaction remains local unless external APIs are connected.

🔧 Customization

You can modify:

Title

Icons

Theme

Layout

AI provider integration

This allows the page to match different environments or workflows.

📌 Status

Active experimental project.

Expect ongoing improvements in:

UI stealth

Performance
